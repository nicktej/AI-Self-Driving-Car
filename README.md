# Self-driving Car

This is a self-driving car developed using PyTorch. The AI uses Deep Q-learning to learn its surroundings, and tries its best to get from point A to B, back to A, and so forth. To make the course harder, the user create obstacles in the form of sand. This would test the car's ability to navigate through the map.

## Mechanics and Measurements

The AI's ability to navigate through the map is influenced by the number of hidden layers, the exploration vs exploitation variables, the degree of punishment/reward, and the 'temperature'. In addition to those, some factors that can be included are time taken to get from point A to B. All these can be adjusted in the code. To measure, the player can click save to see the reward progress. 

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 2. You will need PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
